W Ell! you expert a Prologue to the Play, 

And you expect it too Petition-way 5 
With Chapeau bas 3 bejeeching you t'excuft, 

A damn'd Intrigue of an unpra&ic'd Mufe 5 
Tell you it's fortune waits upon your fniles, 

And when you frown, Lord how you kill the whiles ! 
Or elfe to rally up the (ins of th' Age, 

And bring each Fop in Town upon the Stage 
And in one Prologue run more vices ore, 

Then either Court or City knew before'-) 

And that's a wonder which ivill pleaje you too, 

But my Commijjion s not to pleaje you now. 

Firft then for you grave Dons who love no play 
But what is regular , Great Johnfon’ sway'-, 

Who hate the Monlieur with the Farce and Dr oil, 
But arc for things well faidwith fpirit and foul', 

'Tisyou I mean whofe judgments will admits 
No Interludes of fooling with your Wit 5 
Tou re here defeated, and anon will cry 
s'Death ! wou'd 'twere treafonto write Comedy. 

So ! there's a party loft 5 now for the reft, 

Who fwear they drather hear a fmutty jeft 
Spoken by Nokes<?r Angel ? then aScene ' 

Of the admir'd and well-pennd Cataline} 

Who love the Comtek. Hat, the jig and Dance, 
Things that are fitted to their Ignorance : 

Tou too are quite undone, for here's no Farce, 

Damn me!you lcry, this Play will be mine A - i *- 
Not ferious, nor yet Comtek^, what is't the?z$ 

Th' imperfett iftue of a Lukewarm brain :

As all the after-lickings could not help. 

Bait it then as ye pleaje, we'le not defend it, 

But he that dif-approves it, let him mend it.

To’ve check’d that flame when firft it did begin. 

E’re you the flighted victory had won. 

And a poor harmlefs Virgin quite undone 5

Thinking an humble life 
Might have fecur’d thy Vertue: 

And yet I fhould not hate 'thee for this fin. 

Since thou art bred in fo much innocence, ! 

Thou couldft not dream of falfity in men: 

Oh that it were permitted me to kill this Prince,

But that had harder been tdi me than this : 
she might have made our Lovers conflant too, 

AworkwhichHeavenitfelf canfcarcely doj 
But (imple Nature never taught the way, ^ 

To hide thojepajfions which ffje mufl obey. 5 
Humble Cottages and Cells, 

Where Innocence and Virtue dwells 5 
Then Courts no more fecure can be. 

From Love and dangerous flattery. 

Love in rural triumph reigns, 

As much a God amongfl the Swains, 

As if the Sacrifices paid, 

Were wounded hearts by Monarchs made j . 

And this might well excufe m offence. 

If it be Jo to Love a Prince. 

But Ladies, *tis your hands alone. 

And not his power can raife me to a Throne j 
Without that aid I cannot reign , 

But will return back, to my flocks again. 

Guilliam advances• 

Guill. How go from Court! nay zay not zo. 

Hear me but Jpeaf before you go s 
Whoy zay the Leadies fldould refufe ye. 

The Bleads Tmefire would better ufiye~ 

So long as ye are kind and young, 

I kpow they l clap ye right or wrong.
